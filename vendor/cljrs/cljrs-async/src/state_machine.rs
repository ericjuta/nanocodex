//! Compiled async state machines (Phase H runtime support).
//!
//! When `cljrs_ir::lower::async_lower` rewrites an `^:async` function into a
//! poll function, codegen emits it as a C-ABI *poll function* with the
//! signature
//!
//! ```text
//! extern "C" fn(*mut CljxStateMachine, *mut *const Value) -> i32
//! ```
//!
//! returning [`POLL_PENDING`] / [`POLL_READY`] / [`POLL_THREW`] /
//! [`POLL_GAS_EXHAUSTED`].  This module
//! supplies the runtime side: the [`CljxStateMachine`] that holds the resume
//! state and the spilled live values, the [`CompiledAsyncTask`] `Future`
//! adapter that drives the poll function on the existing `LocalSet` executor,
//! and the readiness helpers the poll function calls at a suspend's resume
//! point.
//!
//! A completed poll function stores its result (or thrown value) into the
//! machine's GC-rooted [`CljxStateMachine::pending`] slot — via
//! `rt_async_set_result` on `Return`, or left there by the readiness check on a
//! failed await — rather than handing back a raw pointer through an
//! out-parameter.  The adapter then reads it as a plain owned `Value`, so no
//! externally-written raw pointer is ever dereferenced on the Rust side.
//!
//! ## GC safety
//!
//! The values that cross a suspend live in [`CljxStateMachine::slots`] (a
//! fixed-length `Vec<Value>` whose backing pointer is stable for the task's
//! lifetime) and the currently-awaited value lives in
//! [`CljxStateMachine::pending`].  [`CompiledAsyncTask`] registers both with the
//! thread-local GC root stacks (`root_values` / `root_value`) and holds those
//! guards across every `.await`, so the collector — which only runs at a
//! cooperative yield when no task is mid-poll (single-threaded `LocalSet`) —
//! traces every suspended task's live values.  This reuses the exact mechanism
//! `eval_async`/`spawn_future` already rely on; there is no separate async root
//! set.  The state machine is boxed (never a `GcPtr`) so its address — and the
//! addresses the root guards capture — stay fixed even as the `Future` moves.
