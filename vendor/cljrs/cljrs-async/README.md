# cljrs-async

Async support for clojurust — `clojure.core.async` implemented via Tokio.

## Purpose

Provides CSP-style concurrency (`go`, `chan`, `put!`, `take!`, `timeout`, `alts`, `alt`) and
the `^:async` / `await` function model, backed by a Tokio `current_thread` + `LocalSet`
executor. All Clojure values remain on a single thread, keeping GC pointers (`!Send`) safe.

## Status

**Phase B1 (per-isolate heaps)** — complete. `Isolate` gives each OS thread its own GC heap,
`current_thread` Tokio runtime, and `LocalSet`. Collections are fully independent with no
cross-isolate coordination. `GcPtr`'s `!Send` bound makes sharing across isolates a compile error.

Done (Phases A–H, A2, B1):

- Phase A: `init()` registers the async runtime hook with the interpreter.
- Phase B: `^:async` fn dispatch via the `AsyncRuntime` hook; `eval_async` tree-walker;
  cooperative `await` of futures/promises.
- Phase C: `deref`/`@` of a future inside an `^:async` body is a runtime error that steers
  callers to `await` (enforced in `cljrs-builtins` and `cljrs-interp` via the
  `cljrs_env::callback::current_is_async` context flag).
- Phase D: `timeout`, `alts`, and the `alt` macro, in a `clojure.core.async` namespace built
  at `init` time. `timeout` and `alts` are native fns that return a `Value::Future`; `alt` is
  a Clojure macro that `await`s `alts` and dispatches to the matching handler.
- Phase E: `chan`, `take!`, `put!`, `close!`, `poll!`, `offer!`, `async-spawn`, and the `go`
  macro. Channels are `CljChannel` `NativeObject`s (buffered or unbuffered/rendezvous).
- Phase F: `join-all` awaits a seq of futures and returns a vector of results. `thread-call`
  runs a thunk and delivers its result to a buffered channel. `onto-chan!` seeds a channel from
  a collection and closes it; `to-chan!` does the same but returns the channel before seeding
  finishes (background task). `mult` broadcasts a source channel to all registered tap channels
  (`tap!`/`untap!`/`untap-all!`). Clojure-level: `async-pmap`, `thread` macro, `merge`,
  `reduce`, `into`. `eval_loop_async` enables proper `await` yielding inside `loop/recur`.
- Phase G: GC safepoints at async yield points via `cljrs_env::gc_roots::async_gc_collect()`,
  called before each `yield_now().await` in `await_value`. Background GC-service task spawned
  by `init()`. Explicit GC root guards for `task_future` in `spawn_future`, callee/env in
  `run_async_fn`, and awaited futures/promises in `await_value`.
- Phase A2: `WorkerPool` singleton — multi-thread Tokio runtime for `Send` byte-level tasks
  (`WorkerPool::global()`, `offload`, `handle`). Pool tasks carry only `Vec<u8>`, `String`, and
  `Send` channel types; `GcPtr`/`Value` construction is confined to LocalSet bridge tasks.
  wasm32 stub runs futures locally.
- Phase B1: `Isolate` type — per-isolate OS thread with independent GC heap (`ISOLATE_HEAP`
  thread-local), `current_thread` Tokio runtime, and `LocalSet`. GC collections are fully
  parallel and independent; no cross-isolate STW coordination.
- Phase B2: `isolate_channel` — cross-isolate copy boundary. `IsolateSender::send` serializes
  a `Value` to a `Send + Sync` wire form (`SerializedValue`, defined in `cljrs-value::clone`);
  `IsolateReceiver::recv`/`try_recv` deserializes it into the receiver's GC heap. Non-shareable
  values (mutable state, closures, native resources) are rejected at send time with a typed
  `CloneError`. Phase B3 (issue #171): a `Var` with a *promotable* (or unbound) root crosses by
  sharing its `shared_root` cell, so a value `def`'d in one isolate is observable by value in
  another; a var bound to a non-promotable root (closure/resource) stays isolate-local and is
  rejected like any other closure. The sender may be cloned (multi-producer); the receiver must stay on its isolate
  thread (single-consumer). `GcPtr`'s `!Send` bound makes pointer-sharing a compile error —
  the channel is the only sanctioned crossing point. Each accepted send is
  **metered** into the process-global `cljrs_gc::GC_STATS` via
  `record_boundary_crossing` (estimated bytes copied + serialize time), so a
  silent fan-out deep-copy is observable in `--gc-stats` rather than mystery
  latency — one of the four visibility guarantees in
  `docs/isolate-boundary-plan.md`. Rejected (non-shareable) sends copy nothing
  and are not metered.
- Phase B2 (Clojure surface): `isolate_builtins` exposes the copy boundary to
  Clojure as a **distinct constructor** (`(isolate-chan) → [tx rx]`), honoring
  the plan's "distinct-at-construction, not per-message" rule — you know a send
  copies because the *target* you hold is an isolate-channel end, not an
  in-isolate `(chan)`. `(isolate-put! tx v)` deep-copies `v` across the boundary
  (returns `true`, or `false` if the receiver is gone) and raises a **located**
  error at the put site if `v` cannot cross. `(isolate-poll! rx)` is a
  non-blocking take; `(isolate-take! rx)` returns a `Future` for use with
  `await`. The *distinct parallel primitive* (`pfuture`/`spawn`) that would run
  Clojure on another isolate is deferred — it needs B3's shared code arena so a
  worker can see the running program's code without copying the world.
- Phase H: `<!!` (blocking take) and `>!!` (blocking put) for synchronous / REPL / test
  contexts. Both use `Condvar`-based parking (with a 1 ms poll-interval fallback so they
  remain non-deadlocking when called from the LocalSet executor thread). Errors with a
  clear message if called inside an `^:async` function body. `CljChannel` condvars also
  replace the previous spin-poll in the IR interpreter's `ChanTake`/`ChanPut` opcodes.

### Channel model

`(chan)` (or `(chan 0)`) is an unbuffered **rendezvous** channel: a `put!` resolves `true`
only once a `take!` consumes its value. `(chan n)` is **buffered**: `put!` succeeds while the
buffer has room, `take!` while it is non-empty. A closed channel drains any buffered values,
then `take!` yields `nil` and `put!` resolves `false`.

Channel operations that can block return a `Value::Future`, so they are used with `await`
inside an async context:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [chan take! put! close! go]])

(def in  (chan 1))
(def out (chan 1))
(go (let [v (await (take! in))]
      (await (put! out (* v 2)))))   ; go spawns the body as an async task
(await (put! in 21))
(await (take! out))                  ; => 42
```

`poll!` (non-blocking take → value or `nil`) and `offer!` (non-blocking buffered put →
`true`/`false`) act synchronously and return immediately. `<!!` and `>!!` are the
blocking sync-context equivalents, suitable for REPL use and tests (see Phase H above).

### Isolate channels — the copy boundary in Clojure

An **isolate** channel is a *distinct constructor* from `(chan)`. The point is
source-visibility (see `docs/isolate-boundary-plan.md`): sending through an
isolate channel deep-copies the value across an isolate boundary, and you know
that because the thing you hold is an isolate-channel end — you do not tag each
send.

```clojure
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [isolate-chan isolate-put! isolate-poll! isolate-take!]])

(let [[tx rx] (isolate-chan)]
  (isolate-put! tx {:a 1 :b [2 3]})  ; deep-copies the map across the boundary → true
  (isolate-poll! rx))                ; => {:a 1 :b [2 3]} (an independent copy), or nil if empty

;; in an async body, park until a value arrives:
(go (await (isolate-take! rx)))
```

`isolate-put!` returns `true` on success, `false` if the receiver is gone, and
**throws at the put site** if the value holds isolate-local state (a closure,
atom, native resource, …) that cannot cross. Every accepted send is metered
into `--gc-stats` (bytes copied + time). The sender is multi-producer
(value-copyable); the receiver is single-consumer and deserializes into the
heap of whichever isolate holds it. Until the parallel primitive lands, both
ends usually live on one isolate, so this behaves as an unbounded queue that
still pays — and meters — the honest deep copy.

### Error propagation: the `<?` family

Channel APIs deliver failures **in band** — an error value (a `Value::Error`, the same
thing `throw` raises and `try`/`catch` catches) is put on the channel instead of a result.
`clojure.rust.error` holds the predicates and the propagation primitive:

- `(error? x)` — true if `x` is an error value.
- `(ok? x)` — true if `x` is non-nil and not an error.
- `(throw-err x)` — return `x`, unless it is an error, in which case `throw` it. This is the
  `?` primitive; the short-circuit is an exception that unwinds to the nearest `try`.

`clojure.core.async` builds the take-and-propagate sugar on top, mirroring Rust's `?`:

| Macro | Expansion | Use in |
|---|---|---|
| `(<? ch)` | `(throw-err (await (take! ch)))` | `go` / `^:async` body |
| `(<?? ch)` | `(throw-err (<!! ch))` | sync / REPL / tests |
| `(go-try body…)` | `(go (try body… (catch Exception e e)))` delivered on a 1-buffer result chan | wraps a body so a thrown error becomes an in-band error on the returned channel |

`<?` is unwrap-or-short-circuit; `go-try` is the boundary that turns a thrown error back into
an in-band error value, so a pipeline of channels propagates errors automatically (each stage
`<?`s its input and is wrapped in `go-try`).

**Error-value fidelity:** a failed future stores the thrown Clojure value
(`FutureState::Failed(Value)`), and `await`/`deref` re-raise it as `EvalError::Thrown`, so
`ex-message`/`ex-data`/`ex-cause` survive across an `await` boundary (and through `<?`/`go-try`).
Gas exhaustion uses the distinct `FutureState::GasExhausted` state and is
re-raised as `EvalError::GasExhausted`, so it cannot be intercepted by a
user-level catch. Every `spawn_future` captures the complete active meter stack
and reinstalls it only for each task poll, preserving nested budgets without
leaking thread-local state across sibling `LocalSet` tasks.

**Known limitation:** `eval_async` does not yet evaluate `try`/`catch` with *yielding* — it
delegates them to the synchronous evaluator — so an `await`/`<?` inside a `try` (and therefore
inside a `go-try` body) takes the synchronous `await` path. That resolves an already-ready value
but is fragile when the awaited value is not yet available. Yielding `try`/`catch` in
`eval_async` is the remaining follow-up.

### `await` and the single-thread executor

`await` only yields when evaluated by `eval_async` (i.e. inside an `^:async` function body or
another async driver). The synchronous `await`/`deref` fallback in `cljrs-interp` blocks the OS
thread on a condvar; doing that to an *async-spawned* future from the `LocalSet` driver thread
deadlocks, because the task that would resolve the future cannot run while the only executor
thread is parked. In Phase B, await async results from within async context. A top-level
blocking bridge is a later phase.

## Integration

**Native (CLI):** The `cljrs` CLI links this crate when built with the `async` feature (on by default).
Rust embedders call `init` from within a Tokio `LocalSet` context:

```rust
let rt = tokio::runtime::Builder::new_current_thread().enable_all().build().unwrap();
let local = tokio::task::LocalSet::new();
rt.block_on(local.run_until(async {
    let globals = cljrs_stdlib::standard_env();
    cljrs_async::init(&globals);
    // ... eval code ...
}));
```

**Calling `init` outside a `LocalSet`:** `init` is also called with no Tokio runtime
at all — by the AOT compiler (which registers `clojure.core.async` only so that
`require`/`go`/`await` resolve during macro-expansion) and by unit tests, as well as
before a `LocalSet` context exists on WASM (e.g. in `Repl::new()`). `spawn_gc_service`
probes `tokio::runtime::Handle::try_current()` and silently no-ops when there is no
runtime, so these callers see no spurious panic. Re-call `init` from inside a
`LocalSet::run_until` block to start the GC service.
`timeout` uses `gloo_timers::future::sleep` on `wasm32` instead of `tokio::time::sleep`.

**Timer portability:** On `wasm32` the `time` feature of tokio is present but
`platform_sleep` (used internally by `timeout`) delegates to `gloo-timers` so that
the browser's `setTimeout` is used instead of a non-functional OS-level clock.
